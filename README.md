# Getting Started with The Traveler App
This is a single-page React application, to begin, run npx json-server --watch db.json and npm start in a separate terminal.

# About The Traveler
The Traveler is a (fictional) blog connecting people with premier dining experiences throughout the globe. This was inspired by a love of travel and an even stronger love for having fantastic meals while traveling.

# Restaurant Recommendation
Visitors of the app have the ability to submit their own recommended restaurant to The Traveler. Once submitted, this restaurant will be seen immediately in the restaurant library.

# Restaurant Library
The restaurant library shows all Traveler-recommended dining spots along with an image, food genre, rating, price point, and covid precautions. This was created at a point in 2020 when it was challenging to find information on outdoor dining availability and any other covid precautions being taken. The next phase of the project is to build a more interactive and robust review system where patrons can leave reviews with updated covid precautions, among other restaurant information.

# Search Filters
To filter through the restaurants by location, there's a dropdown filter. As well, patrons have the ability to search for restaurants by name using a text-search bar. Although this is a fictional app with a relatively manageable data library, it felt important for the user experience to include various filter & search options.
